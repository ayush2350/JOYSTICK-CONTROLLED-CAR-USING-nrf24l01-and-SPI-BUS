# JOYSTICK-CONTROLLED-CAR-USING-nrf24l01-and-SPI-BUS
In this project I used NRFL2401. It is a wireless transceiver module, which means each NRFL2401 module can send as well as receive data. It operates in the frequency of 2.4 GHz.
NRFL2401 communicates over a 4 pin Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) with a maximum data transfer rate of 10 Mbps.
